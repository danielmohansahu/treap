# treap
Python implementation of a Binary Search Tree / Heap; i.e. a Treap

This code requires a modern installation of Python3 and was tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

All instructions assume an Ubuntu user, but the code should function following nominal OSX / Windows Python conventions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielmohansahu/treap
```

Then you can navigate to the installed 'treap' folder and execute top level scripts like so:

python3 test.py

# execute ENPM809X Project #1 steps and output results to STDOUT
python3 enpm809x.py
```



## Pip Installation

To clone and install this package via pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielmohansahu/treap
pip install treap/

This form of installation installs package scripts so the user can execute them from the command line as follows:

```bash
# run unit tests
pytreap_run_tests.py -v

# execute ENPM809X Project #1 steps and output results to STDOUT
pytreap_enpm809x_results.py
